# About API

The `Rahn Monitor API Documentation` provides a platform for Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing services. Its primary goal is to assist clients in complying with their PEP/Sanction and Adverse Media screening obligations. By using the API, clients can easily query entities and individuals into their applications within seconds.

## Type of API

The `Rahn Monitor` uses the `REST-API` type of API, which is a common and widely-used standard for building web services. RESTful APIs are designed to be flexible, scalable, and easily integrated with other applications.

## Billing

To use the API, clients need to have an enabled API key linked to their account, with active billing charged per API call. The `Rahn Monitor` application displays the costs for the client's usage, and the Rahn Monitor Team invoices the client on a monthly basis for the API.

## Get the API

Clients can contact the `Rahn Monitor` team today at `info@rahn.co.za` to get the API keys. The team will arrange a meeting to assist clients in getting started with the integration process.
